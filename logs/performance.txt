starting position divide(4)
first working perft: 450,000nps
inlining everything and a bit of profiling: 630,000nps
implemented custom MoveList class over std::vector and removed shared_ptrs: 775,000nps
implemented arrays for castling/enpassant history instead of std::vectors and: 3.5mnps
general cleanup, removed some more dynamically allocated data structures: 4.0 mnps

new benchmark:
perft(5) from starting position: 4.9mnps
